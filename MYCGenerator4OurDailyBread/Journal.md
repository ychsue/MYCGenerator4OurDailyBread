I have used Inkscape to create one svg file and use the extension [UWP Visual Assets Generator](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/b3c94468-96bc-4860-8860-4458ab3bc467/view/) to generate all icons for this APP.  
It's time to try to submit this APP. ^_^_

Now I can launch MemorizeYC from this App. Remember that, you need to provide its `TargetApplicationPackageFamilyName` which can be found as described in [this StackOverflow's Q&A](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/40456200/universal-app-folderpicker-system-runtime-interopservices-comexception).

Now I can play the audio; however, I still do not have a clear view about how to use *Position* and *NaturalDuration* of a MediaElement to control the audio.

Now, I can store the languages into *ApplicationData.Current.LocalSettings* every time they change the language, so that they can get their desired languages when they launch this App.
